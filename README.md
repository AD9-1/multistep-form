# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form

![Design preview for the Multi-step form coding challenge](./src/design_final/desktop_preview.png)(./src/design_final/mobile_preview.png)

## Overview! ðŸ‘‹
Your challenge is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
## The challenge
Challenge I faced is to resize the form structure to fit in viewport height and width. This challege does not fit in Blackberry and IPhone SE reponsive screens.

Your users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
